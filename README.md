A view in SQL is a virtual table that represents the result of a saved query. It does not store data physically but dynamically displays data from one or more underlying tables. Views help simplify complex queries, provide data abstraction, and enhance security by exposing only selected parts of the data.

To create a view, a developer writes a SELECT query and saves it under a view name. This view can then be used just like a regular table in future queries. For example, a view might show only employee names and departments, hiding sensitive data like salaries. Another view could filter records to show only high-earning employees, or calculate summary data like average salary per department.

Views are especially useful for reusing frequently needed query logic and for allowing different users controlled access to specific subsets of data. While views can simplify reporting and improve database design, not all views can be updatedâ€”especially those with complex operations like grouping or joins.
